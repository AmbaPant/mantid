In your main window for workbench, you may notice a few options in the upper left hand corner. From here you can access
drop down menus which will facilitate options, to do things such as change the settings, save scripts, save projects,
restore defaults for the window and more.

File Menu
---------

From this menu, you will have access to the more standard options, such as save and load (Open) for the scripts in
:ref:`WorkbenchScriptWindow` and :ref:`Project`. Also it is possible to access further options such as the settings
and manager user directories dialogues. Alternatively to clicking the close button in the top right, the quit option
here performs the exact same operation.

The manage user directory dialogue, is useful for allowing search of the archive using the load algorithm and other
parts of mantid that rely on the file finder.

View Menu
---------

Interfaces Menu
