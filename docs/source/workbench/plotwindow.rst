==================
Workbench Plotting
==================
In Mantid Workbench, the old plotting from MantidPlot has been replaced by the Matplotlib python library. It has been
integrated seamlessly into the interface to work the same way as the previous method alongside some added benefits such
as the extra customisation and improved plotting window. Matplotlib has very high customisation, via scripting and has
some functionality exposed via the new plotting window's settings.
