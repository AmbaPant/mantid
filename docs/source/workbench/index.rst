TO BE RE-WRITTEN BY NICK OR MARTYN
Mantid Workbench is the newest major release of Mantid. The big changes in this release is that Workbench will be
released alongside, MantidPlot. Workbench is a completely new GUI, built from the ground up, it should be more stable
and allow for future development and changes to be completed much faster than they were in MantidPlot.

===========================
What is there in Workbench?
===========================

Most of what users currently use in Mantid Plot is or will be incorporated into workbench. This includes but is not
limited to, user group interfaces, scripting window (fully integrated into the main window), workspace display,
algorithm widgets, and plotting.


Workbench Windows
-----------------
One of the immediate things that is noticeable about workbench, is all the windows integrated into the main window.
These can be dragged away and out of the main window docks. Examples can be found here:
:ref:`WorkbenchDraggableWindows`.

Workspace Toolbox
-----------------

The :ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox` is a key part of workbench and if a you are familiar with MantidPlot it function
very similarly. From here you can see all of the workspaces currently available to the User. Here you can load,
save, group, delete, sort, plot, and more a breakdown of these features can be found here:
:ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox`


Algorithm Toolbox
-----------------

    :align: center

The :ref:`WorkbenchAlgorithmToolbox` is another key part of the workbench, once again if you are familiat with
MantidPlot it functions very similarly. From here you can access and run all of the algorithms that Mantid Workbench has
to offer to it's users. To find algorithms there are two options for navigation, if you know the name then doing a
search in the search bar, the other option is selecting it's category and navigating utilising the menu.

Script Window
-------------

The :ref:`WorkbenchScriptWindow` is another key part of the workbench. The script window allows you to write a python
script which integrates with the Mantid framework and operate on the data loaded in via the workspaces. The script
window contains a Status bar, multiple tabs for different scripts, the ability to play, and the ability to stop
alongside some further options explored more here: :ref:`WorkbenchScriptWindow`

Message Window
--------------

All of the output from your scripts and algorithm's ran from interfaces or other buttons will be output here. This is
alongside the ability change the logging level. The logging level has 5 different options to display the right level of
detail for you, all this and more is discussed further here: :ref:`WorkbenchMessagesWindow`

Main Window Menu
----------------
The :ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox` is a key part of workbench and if a you are familiar with MantidPlot it function
very similarly. From here you can see all of the :ref:`Workspace` s currently available to the User. Here you can load,
save, group, delete, sort, plot, and more a breakdown of these features can be found here:
:ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox` .

Plot Toolbox
------------
The :ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox` is a key part of workbench and if a you are familiar with MantidPlot it function
very similarly. From here you can see all of the :ref:`Workspace` s currently available to the User. Here you can load,
save, group, delete, sort, plot, and more a breakdown of these features can be found here:
:ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox` .

IPython Console
