TO BE RE-WRITTEN BY NICK OR MARTYN
Mantid Workbench is the newest major release of Mantid. The big changes in this release is that Workbench will be
released alongside, MantidPlot. Workbench is a completely new GUI, built from the ground up, it should be more stable
and allow for future development and changes to be completed much faster than they were in MantidPlot.

===========================
What is there in Workbench?
===========================

Most of what users currently use in Mantid Plot is or will be incorporated into workbench. This includes but is not
limited to, user group interfaces, scripting window (fully integrated into the main window), workspace display,
algorithm widgets, and plotting.


Workbench Windows
-----------------
One of the immediate things that is noticeable about workbench, is all the windows integrated into the main window.
These can be dragged away and out of the main window docks. Examples can be found here:
:ref:`WorkbenchDraggableWindows`.

Workspace Toolbox
-----------------

# Investigate using class directives to force this to line up properly

The :ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox` is a key part of workbench and if a you are familiar with MantidPlot it function
very similarly. From here you can see all of the :ref:`Workspace`s currently available to the User. Here you can load,
save, group, delete, sort, plot, and more a breakdown of these features can be found here:
:ref:`WorkbenchWorkspaceToolbox`.
