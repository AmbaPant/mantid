The algorithm toolbox is another key part of the workbench, once again if you are familiar with
MantidPlot it functions very similarly. From here you can access and run all of the algorithms that Mantid Workbench has
to offer to it's users. To find algorithms there are two options for navigation, if you know the name then doing a
search in the search bar, the other option is selecting it's category and navigating utilising the menu.
