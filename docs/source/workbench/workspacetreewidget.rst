very similarly. From here you can see all of the workspaces currently available to the User. Here you can load,
save, group, delete, sort, plot and more.

Workspace
---------

The workspaces listed in the Workspace Toolbox will display their metadata when the dropdown arrow is toggled, this is
showed in the diagram under the Workspace label. If you right click the Workspaces displayed in the Workspace Toolbox it
will display the context menu for a Workspace. If you double click the workspace object a window pops up with the data.

Workspace Options
-----------------

The workspace options are relatively self explanatory. However Key differences includes that Load has the option to load
a file or run a live data listener. Delete will remove the Workspace from the Workspace Toolbox and make it unusable by
Mantid anymore. After selecting multiple workspaces in the list part of the workspaces then it will, allow you to click
Group and make them part of a WorkspaceGroup. The Sort option has multiple choices with the option to make you sort via
ascending and descending order for name, size, and last modified.

Workspace Context Menu
----------------------
