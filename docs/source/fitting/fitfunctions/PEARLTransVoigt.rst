Description
-----------

The Voigt profile is used in spectroscopy when a given line shape is neither a Gaussian nor a Lorentzian but rather is a
convolution of the two. This function is described in Igor Technical Note 26 [1]_. Its relative accuracy is better than
0.0001 and most of the time is much better. This function, as coded, is currently only to be used on PEARL data in the
Transfit algorithm.
