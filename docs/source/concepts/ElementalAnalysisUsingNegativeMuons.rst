Overview
--------
This is a non-destructive , depth selective method of determining the elemental composition of a sample using characteristic Xrays 
from  Muonic atoms.
 
What happens when a muon is implanted in a sample?
--------------------------------------------------
* Muon is captured by an atom, forming a mounic atom.
* Muon cascades down atom to N = 1  (1s) energy level within :math:`~10e-13` seconds emitting muonic x-rays [#HIL1]_.
* Muon maybe captured by the nucleus releasing gamma rays and following reaction may occur [#MEA]_. 

	µ-  +  p   →    ν  + n

Controlling implantation depth of muons 
---------------------------------------
* Implantation depth is proportional to momentum of muons and is also dependent on the density of materials.
* At ISIS, the momentum of muons can be tuned from 17 MeV/c to 120 MeV/c [#MAT]_.
* The maximum depth is a few metres for most gases depending on the pressure and about a few centimetres for most metals with a resolution of few 10s to 100s of microns.

Advantages over other methods
-----------------------------
* Compared with X-ray fluorescence it releases energy of higher magnitude as the mass of a muon is over 200 times greater than an electron.
* Can probe beneath the surface of material.
* Is non destructive.
* Can detect elements with low atomic numbers.
* Can distinguish different isotopes.
