Description
-----------

This algorithm is part of the new workflow for :ref:`normalizing <MDNorm>` multi-dimensional event workspaces.
It is intended to :ref:`crop <algm-CropWorkspace>` the input event workspace, and store the end 
of detector trajectories in either momentum (diffraction) or energy transfer (inelastic) units.
