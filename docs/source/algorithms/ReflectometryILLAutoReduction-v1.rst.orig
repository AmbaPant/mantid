Description
-----------

This is the reduction work-flow algorithm for the ILL reflectometers D17 and FIGARO.
A various number of corresponding direct and reflected angles can be processed.
Please note, however, to not delete direct beam work-spaces for efficient re-use for further reductions.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The information transfer between direct beam and reflected beam work-spaces is realized via sample log information exchange.
The sample log information which will be passed, are the scattering angle `twoTheta` and the direct beam's `peak_position` workspace index.
Workspace index, spectrum number and detector index start all with 0.
=======
The information transfer between direct beam and reflected beam work-spaces is realized via sample log information exchange, see :ref:`ReflectometryILLPreProcess <algm-ReflectometryILLPreProcess>` for more information.
