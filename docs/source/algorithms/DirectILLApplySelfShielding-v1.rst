Description
-----------

This algorithm subtracts empty container data and applies self-shielding corrections to *InputWorkspace*. Both operations are optional: what is actually done depends on the input properties.

*SelfShieldingCorrectionWorkspace* can be obtained from the :ref:`DirectILLSelfShielding <algm-DirectILLSelfShielding>` algorithm.
