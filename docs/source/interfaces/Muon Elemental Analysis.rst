Interface overview
------------------
The interface is used to compare data from the Muon detector with the emission spectra of given elements. The interface
can be accessed from the main menu in MantidPlot and workbench: *Interfaces → Muon → Elemental Analysis*.

Loading
-------
Enter a run number (e.g. 6295) and press *Load*

Plotting
--------
Tick the boxes corresponding to the detector you want to display. For each detector, a separate plot should appear in
the same window. Each plot contains 3 lines: *Prompt*, *Delayed* and *Total*.
To remove one or more lines on the top right corner of the plot press *Remove line*, a table should appear. Select the
lines you want to remove and press *OK*.
