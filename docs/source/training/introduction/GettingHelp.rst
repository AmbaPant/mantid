CS Group
--------

Antti Soininen, Gagik Vardanyan, Verena Reimund and Ian Bush are the active Mantid developers, and Miguel Gonzalez the scientific lead for the Mantid adoption project at the ILL. We can all help you with any problems with Mantid, please email or drop by the CS office at any time (Room 221, ILL 4). We are in close contact with the wider development team for any problems we may not know the answer to.

Mantid Documentation
--------------------

See the `Mantid Documentation <https://www.mantidproject.org/Documentation>`__ website for more information on installing and using Mantid. Two pages of particular interest are:
 * `Algorithm Descriptions <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/index.html>`__ - detailed descriptions of all the algorithms in Mantid, with links to the source code
 * `Python API <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/api/python/index.html>`__ - full documentation for the Python API Mantid provides

Some of this documentation is also available off-line in Mantid, via Help -> Mantid Plot.

Bug Reporting
-------------

Please report any bugs you find, so that we can keep improving Mantid. The easiest way is to contact the development team in the CS group, especially for any issues that are causing major problems.

There is also an option to report bugs in Mantid, via Help -> Report a Bug, but please only use this for minor bugs. This link allows bugs to be posted on the forums. Alternatively you can use the `contact form <https://www.mantidproject.org/Contact>`__ or email mantid-help@mantidproject.org.
