Main MantidPlot menu -> Interfaces -> Indirect -> Indirect Data Analysis

From the concept page:

The Indirect Data Analysis interface is a collection of tools within MantidPlot
for analysing reduced data from indirect geometry spectrometers.

The majority of the functions used within this interface can be used with both
reduced files (*_red.nxs*) and workspaces (*_red*) created using the Indirect Data
Reduction interface or using :math:`S(Q, \omega)` files (*_sqw.nxs*) and
workspaces (*_sqw*) created using either the Indirect Data Reduction interface or
taken from a bespoke algorithm or auto reduction.

These interfaces do not support GroupWorkspaces as input.
