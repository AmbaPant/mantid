Improvements
############

- Enable workbench to plot 1D spectrum from an IMDHistoWorkspace whose non-integrated dimension is equal to 1 but not to launch slice viewer.
- Enabled the plotting of individual functions in the Workbench fit browser. This replicates a feature that was in MantidPlot.
  Plotting of each function can be performed by right clicking on the function within the browser and selecting plot.
