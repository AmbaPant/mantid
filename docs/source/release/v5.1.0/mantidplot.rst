**Workbench is replacing MantidPlot**, while MantidPlot is still fully functional for this release,
**MantidPlot will not be included in future releases**.
Please move over to using the workbench for all new work, and ongoing work that will last more than the next few months.
MantidPlot has not received any updates or bug fixes for the last year, and as such the workbench is a more stable and
functional user interface in many areas.

We have created a high level `comparison of the functionality <https://www.mantidproject.org/Workbench_Feature_Comparison>`_
to help you easily see some of the differences.
The overall user interface appears and operates very similarly to MantidPlot, so the experience of moving over
to the workbench should be smooth and easy.
The workbench can even load all of the workspaces (although not the graphs) from a saved MantidPlot Project file
if you want to transfer ongoing work.

If you run into any problems or have any questions please ask them on our `user forum <https://forum.mantidproject.org/>`_.
