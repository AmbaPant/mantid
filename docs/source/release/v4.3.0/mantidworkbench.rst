- If you have ever found it hard to spot when errors appear in the Messages window, and perhaps miss them if there are lots of graphs on the screen, then you will like this.  We have added system notifications when Mantid enounters an error, and directs you to look at the Messages window for details.  You can enable or disable these notifications from the File->Settings window.
