Powder Diffraction
------------------

- :ref:`PolDiffILLDiffraction <algm-PolDiffILLDiffraction>` now supports data reduction of D7 Time-of-flight mode, including elastic peak calibration, time-dependent background subtraction, detector-analyser energy efficiency correction, and frame-overlap correction
- :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>` now supports cross-section separation, normalisation and proper unit setting, including conversion to S(Q, w), of D7 Time-of-flight mode data
