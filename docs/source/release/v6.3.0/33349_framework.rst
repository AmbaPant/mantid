- The source links at the bottom of each algorithm page no longer include the
  last-modified date. The dates were misleading in most cases as no meaningful
  changes to the algorithm had actually occurred and could be something as
  simple as formatting changes. Moving forward, each algorithm will now
  document any significant changes of behaviour across versions in a dedicated
  section within its own page.
