BugFixes
########
- Updated misleading cut algorithm names and made selection of cut algorithms available on cut tab.
- Fixed 'Save to Workspace' button on cut tabs and renamed it to 'Save to Workbench' to avoid confusion.
- Prevented non-Mslice plots to be displayed as an MSlice plot as most buttons and menu items can not work in this case.
- Added check for deprecated hold feature in pyplot.py.
