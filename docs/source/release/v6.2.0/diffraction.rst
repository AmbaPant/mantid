Powder Diffraction
------------------
New features
############

Improvements
############
- :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` major interface update along with enabling the calibration of T0 and sample position.
- :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` minor interface update that allows fine control of bank rotation calibration.

Bugfixes
########
- fix d-spacing calculation when parabolic model is selected.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------
- The workflows for Calibration and Focussing in the EnggDiffraction GUI and EnginX scripts have been replaced to make use of faster, better tested C++ algorithms (PDCalibration).
- The following algorithms have been deprecated, and will likely be removed entirely in the next release: EnggCalibrate, EnggCalibrateFull, EnggFocus, EnggVanadiumCorrections

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------
New features
############
- New algorithm :ref:`HB3AIntegrateDetectorPeaks <algm-HB3AIntegrateDetectorPeaks>` for integrating four-circle data from HB3A in detector space.
- New algorithm :ref:`ApplyInstrumentToPeaks <algm-ApplyInstrumentToPeaks>` to update the instrument of peaks within a PeaksWorkspace.
- New plotting script that provides diagnostic plots of SCDCalibratePanels output.

Improvements
############
- Find detector in peaks will check which det is closer when dealing with peak-in-gap situation for tube-type detectors.
- Existing :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` now provides better calibration of panel orientation for flat panel detectors.

Bugfixes
########

:ref:`Release 6.2.0 <v6.2.0>`
