- New feature: Functions have been extended to allow for Function Attribute Validators. This feature further extends to the FitPropertyBrowser.
  This allows the value of attributes to be restricted in numerous ways, using validators already available in the Mantid Kernel. Examples of validation include (but are not limited to):
    - A numeric value being bound by a numeric min/max.
    - A string value having to be be selected from a list of possible values.
    - A string value being required to contain specific sub-strings.
