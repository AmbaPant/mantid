An error is fixed in Abins. This relates to the assignment of
"Forward" and "Backward" detector settings for TOSCA, which were
reversed from their conventional definition. The default behaviour has
not changed: results will only be affected for calculations which
explicitly selected the "Forward (TOSCA)" or "Backward (TOSCA)"
options.
