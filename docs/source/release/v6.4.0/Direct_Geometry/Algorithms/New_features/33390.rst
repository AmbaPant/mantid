- A new Abins2D algorithm has been added for simulation of inelastic neutron scattering in direct-geometry

  - This employs the same almost-isotropic analytic powder-averaging incoherent approximation as Abins
  - The ISIS MARI, MAPS, and MERLIN instruments are supported, alongside ILL-PANTHER and a "TwoDMap" ideal simulation. Please direct requests/specifications for additional instruments to Sanghamitra Mukhopadhyay and Adam Jackson.
  - The algorithm produces workspaces in (E,q) space, best viewed interactively in Sliceviewer, or rendered as colorfill plots
