- :ref:`CorrectTOFAxis <algm-CorrectTOFAxis>` can now accept fractional bin indices for more precise calculation of the elastic peak position calibration
- :ref:`DirectILLCollectData <algm-DirectILLCollectData>` will now accept fractional elastic peak reference bin as well as forward fractional elastic
  peak index to the :ref:`CorrectTOFAxis <algm-CorrectTOFAxis>`
- :ref:`DirectILLApplySelfShielding <algm-DirectILLApplySelfShielding>` now ensures that the subtracted container and self-attenuation correction workspaces
  have consistent binning with the provided sample to be corrected by rebinning to the sample
