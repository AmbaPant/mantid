- ILL SANS reduction suite has been refactored, providing up to 2 orders of magnitude of speed-up for kinetic monochromatic measurements. The new algorithm :ref:`SANSILLMultiProcess <algm-SANSILLMultiProcess>` steers the reduction of the whole experiment, using the new version of the :ref:`SANSILLReduction-v2 <algm-SANSILLReduction-v2>`.
