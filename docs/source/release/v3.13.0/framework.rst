Bug fixes
#########

- The documentation of the algorithm :ref:`algm-CreateSampleWorkspace` did not match its implementation. The axis in beam direction will now be correctly described as Z instead of X.

Algorithms
----------

- :ref:`ConvertToPointData <algm-ConvertToPointData>` and :ref:`ConvertToHistogram <algm-ConvertToHistogram>` now propagate the Dx errors to the output.
- The algorithm :ref:`algm-Stitch1D` can now receive point data as input workspaces and does apply a full overlap while keeping corresponding Dx values.


:ref:`Release 3.13.0 <v3.13.0>`
