Improved
########
- :ref:`Maxent <algm-Maxent>` when outputting the results of the iterations, it no longer pads with zeroes but
  returns as many items as iterations done for each spectrum, making the iterations easy to count.
- :ref:`ConvertToPointData <algm-ConvertToPointData>` and :ref:`ConvertToHistogram <algm-ConvertToHistogram>` now propagate the Dx errors to the output.

:ref:`Release 3.13.0 <v3.13.0>`
