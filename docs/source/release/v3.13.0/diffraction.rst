Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

- Improvements to the GSAS tab:

  - GSASIIRefineFitPeaks is now run asynchronously in the GUI, so the
    tab no longer locks when a refinement is run
  - A **Refine All** button was added to run refinement on every run
    loaded into the tab

:ref:`Release 3.13.0 <v3.13.0>`
