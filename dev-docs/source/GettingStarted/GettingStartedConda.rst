Environment

This is where we will run through the instructions for Windows, MacOS, Debian (Ubuntu) and CentOS (CentOS7 and RHEL) based systems for developing in mantid. To do this we will:
  * Install any OS none-Conda requirements (e.g. Visual Studio)
  * Install Git
  * Clone the Source
  * Download and install Mambaforge (a stripped down version of Conda that defaults to Condaforge, combined with mamba to improve environment resolution time).

Navigate to the dedicated page for each OS
