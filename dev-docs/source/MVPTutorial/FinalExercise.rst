Final Exercise
==============

Now that we have a complete View and Model all that is left to do is
bring it all together in our Presenter. In this exercise you will need
to create three presenters.

1. A presenter to interact with ``view``, setting the allowed colour
   options from your ``ColourConverter`` Model and getting the values
   from your table.
2. A presenter to interact with ``viewPlot``, passing x and y values
   from your ``DataGenerator`` Model to be plotted.
3. A presenter to interact with ``viewMaster`` and ``Model`` directly
   and calling functions in your other presenters.

See :ref:`here <CompleteGUI>` for the solution and complete functioning
GUI.
