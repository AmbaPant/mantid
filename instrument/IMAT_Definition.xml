     Each bank contains five modules, stacked vertically above each other. 
     The modules are of identical design, but the modules are not quite symmetrical in the horizontal direction.
     Accordingly, the modules in the South bank are installed upside down relative to those in the North bank.
     This ensures that the range of two-theta angles is the same for both banks. -->

		 Z-axis, turning it upside down. The pixel two theta values will be correct, but the order of the

		 bottom to top. The new Y axis will also point downwards. -->
